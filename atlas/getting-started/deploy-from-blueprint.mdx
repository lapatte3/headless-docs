Now that you have [chosen a blueprint](./blueprint-repository), you can clone it in GitHub and deploy it to Atlas. Pushing to your main branch in GitHub will then deploy updates to Atlas automatically.

Atlas blueprints use the [Faust.js](https://faustjs.org/) framework based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Atlas also supports other frameworks that run on Node.js.

## Create Atlas App

### 1. Connect to GitHub

Connect your GitHub account so you can clone Atlas blueprints.

1. Under `Connect to GitHub`, select `Connect`.

2. GitHub opens in another tab of your web browser. Give WP Engine permission to access your repositories.

After Atlas connects to your GitHub account, the `Connect` button indicates that you are `Connected`.

### 2. Create a repository

Now that GitHub is connected, it's time to create a repository where your Blueprint code is going to be stored.

1. Select your GitHub account

In case you don't see the account for which you'd like to create a repository on the list, click on "Manage GitHub app" on the top of the screen:

2. Type a name of your repository

Depending on which Blueprint you chose, Atlas will suggest a repository name for you. Name of your repository should be unique within your GitHub account - in case it's not, you'll be returned an error after clicking the "Create" button on the bottom of the page.

3. Select the visibility of your repository

If you want your repository to be visible to people that can only access your GitHub account, make sure to check the "Private repository" checkbox.

4. Select a region for your Atlas app. The region you select will be used for all of your app's environments (production/staging/etc.) and cannot be changed once your Atlas application has been deployed.

7. Click `Create App`.

That's it! Track the initial build progress on the next screen that loads automatically. The repository with Blueprint code as well as new WordPress install 

### 3. Find the link to your frontend site and WordPress admin

A link to visit your live frontend using a temporary domain will appear under `Atlas URL` when the deploy completes.
