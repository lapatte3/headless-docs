## Description

Manually invoke a rebuild of a specified application environment.

## Usage

```bash
$ wpe envs rebuild $ENV_ID [OPTIONS]
```

## Extended Description

The `wpe envs rebuild` command allows you manually rebuild a specified environment for the application. It kicks off the same process that occurs when a new commit is pushed to git.

## Options

```
--app, -a    The app name
--help, -h   Help for rebuild
```

## Examples

Let's assume the environment ID is `bmna3gedlzerwcb4vc04gssl` and the app name is `myapp`. Running the following command will rebuild the environment:

```bash
$ wpe envs rebuild bmna3gedlzerwcb4vc04gssl -a myapp
```
