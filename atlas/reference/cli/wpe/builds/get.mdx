## Description

Get details of a specific build for an app's environment.

## Usage

```bash
$ wpe builds get $BUILD_ID [OPTIONS]
```

## Extended Description

The `wpe builds get` command will print information about a specific build for an app's environment. In order to use this command you will need the build ID. Refer to the [`wpe builds list`](./list) command for how to get build ID of a specific app's environment.

## Options

```
--help, -h    Help for get
```

## Examples

Let's assume your build ID is `sqeq3na34owo8see7xwro5o8`. Run the following command to see information about the build:

```bash
$ wpe builds get sqeq3na34owo8see7xwro5o8
```

Running the above command will print something that looks similar to the following:

```bash
ID: sqeq3na34owo8see7xwro5o8
APP_NAME:       myapp
