## Description

Remove a WP Engine Headless Application

## Usage

```bash
$ wpe apps delete $APP_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

## Extended Description

The `wpe apps delete` command allows you to remove an existing WP Engine Headless Application. Use the [`wpe apps list`](./list) command to get a list of the apps that you can delete. By default, this command will prompt you to re-enter the app name to ensure you are deleting the right app. You can override this with `--force`, which is useful if you are using automation to delete the app.

> > **NOTE:** Once you delete an app you can no longer create a new app with the same name, since apps need to have unique names

## Options

```
--force       Force delete, avoid all prompts
--help, -h    Help for delete
```

## Examples

### Delete "myapp"

```bash
$ wpe apps delete myapp
```
