## Description

Update an existing WP Engine Headless Application

## Usage

```bash
$ wpe apps update [OPTIONS]
```

## Extended Description

The `wpe apps update` command allows you to update an existing WP Engine Headless Application. Use the [`wpe apps list`](./list) command to get a list of the apps that you can update. You provide the GitHub repository you want to use, the environments you want to deploy, and the name of your app. Running the command will deploy the code from your repository to the corresponding environments.

The `repository` is a reference to your GitHub repository. For example, if your GitHub repository is `https://github.com/organization/myapp` then the value your use for `repository` will be `organization/myapp`.

The `environments` correspond to the WP Engine User Portal environments where you have your WP site. So if your domain is `myapp.wpengine.com`, your environment would be `myapp`.

## Options

```
--environments, -e Environments in JSON format (use with -n, -r flags; surround value with single quotation marks)
--filepath, -f     Path to file with JSON of the app to update (use without -e, -n, -r flags)
--help, -h         Help for update
--name, -n         Assign a name to the app (optional use with -e, -r flags)
--repo, -r         GitHub repo associated with the app (use with -e, -n flags)
```

## Examples

### Update With A wpe.json File

The simplest way to update your app is by configuring a `wpe.json` file with the variables necessary to deploy the application. Something like the following:

```json
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "repo": "organization/myapp",
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "branch": "main",
      "wp_environment_name": "YOUR WordPress environment name",
      "env_variables": [
        {
          "key": "WORDPRESS_URL",
          "value": "https://yoururl"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

With the above file created, you can update and redeploy your app with a single command:

```bash
$ wpe apps update -f wpe.json
```
