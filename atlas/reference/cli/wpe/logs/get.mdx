## Description

Get the application logs for the WP Engine Headless CLI.

## Usage

```bash
$ wpe logs get [OPTIONS]
```

## Extended Description

The `wpe logs get` command will print the current account logs that the WP Engine Headless CLI is using to deploy applications.

## Options

```
--help, -h   Help for get
```

## Examples

Let's assume the environment ID is `bmna3gedlzerwcb4vc04gssl` and the app name is `myapp`. Running the following command will print the logs for the environment:

```bash
$ wpe logs get -e bmna3gedlzerwcb4vc04gssl -a myapp
```

The above command will print something similar to the following:

```text
TIMESTAMP               SEVERITY        MESSAGE
