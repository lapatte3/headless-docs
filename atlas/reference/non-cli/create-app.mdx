description: Atlas Node Engine API Reference - Create a new WP Engine Headless Application
---

# Purpose
This functionality allows you to create a new WP Engine Headless Application, without using `Atlas CLI`.

# Prerequsites
In order to allow this functionality you must first create API access by generating auth credentials in User Portal - `Portal > Username dropdown > Profile > API access (tab) > Generate credentials`.
The screenshots below walk you through what you will see. Next, copy the API credentials & ensure you have CURL installed locally.

# Running Create app command in CURL
Run the following commands replacing the path capitals and `shellVariables` with your own values.

The `{PUT_YOUR_ENV_NAME_HERE}` corresponds to the WP Engine User Portal environments where you have your WP site. So if your domain is `myapp.wpengine.com`, your environment would be `myapp`.

The available regions for `{PUT_REGION_HERE}` variable are `US-C` or `EU-W`.

- Create an Atlas Application:
```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u "PUT_USER_ID_HERE:PUT_PASSWORD_HERE" \
'https://jsstaging.wpengineapi.com/v1/accounts/{PUT_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE}/apps?appId={PUT_YOUR_NEW_APP_NAME_HERE}' \
--data-raw '{"region":"regions/{PUT_REGION_HERE}","uploadable":{}}'
```

- Connect an app with the environment corresponding to the WP Engine User Portal environments where you have your WP site.
```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u "PUT_USER_ID_HERE:PUT_PASSWORD_HERE" \
'https://jsstaging.wpengineapi.com/v1/accounts/{PUT_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE}/apps/{PUT_YOUR_NEW_APP_NAME_HERE}/environments' \
--data-raw '{"displayName":"{PUT_YOUR_ENV_NAME_HERE}","branch":"uploadable","wpEnvironment":"{PUT_YOUR_WORDPRESS_INSTALL_NAME_HERE}","shellVariables":[{"key":"foo","value":"bar"}]}'
```

Example long-running operation response, that starts application deployment to the environment.
```
{
    "name": "accounts/{ACCOUNT_NAME}/apps/{YOUR_NEW_APP_NAME}/environments/{ENV_UUID}/operations/no_build",
    "metadata": {
        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/wpengine.js.apps.v1.UpdateEnvironmentMetadata",
        "build": "accounts/{ACCOUNT_NAME}/apps/{YOUR_NEW_APP_NAME}/environments/{ENV_UUID}/builds/no_build",
        "deployment": ""
    },
    "done": false
}
```

###Notes:
In case of Create an Atlas Application CURL HTTP Response will give `200` status, but will not return a response body, if successful. If you would like more detail add the `-i` (include the HTTP response headers in the output) or `-v` (makes curl verbose during the operation) flag to the above CURL command. You can also check Portal to see the Atlas Environment buildng state.
