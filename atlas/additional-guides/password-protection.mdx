title: Password Protection
description: Protect your Atlas environments with password.
---

On Atlas, you can choose to protect your environments with password. This can be configured in your environment's "Settings" screen:

Once there, find the "Password protection" section on the screen and turn the feature on with toggle:

Specify the password you want to use for your site. By default, the environment and all of its preview environments will be protected with the same password. If you wish to apply password protection to preview environments only, then make sure to check the "Preview environments only" checkbox.

Click "Save" - for password protection to take place, all of the affected environments must be redeployed. This will be triggered automatically once you click the "Save" button. Any changes in the setting (changing your password / turning the protection off) will also result in a redeploy of affected environments.

Once redeploy is complete, your sites will be protected with password. Upon login, the cookie will be persisted for the next 24 hours, so until the cookie is valid, you won't be asked to retype the password as long as you're accessing your site from the same browser.

To turn the password protection off, go back to settings screen and change your password setting. As previously, this change will trigger a redeploy of affected environments. Once complete, site will no longer be protected with password.
