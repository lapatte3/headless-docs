## Community Support

Join the [Headless WordPress Discord Server](https://discord.gg/J2khkF9XYK) to talk with others building headless WordPress projects. There, developers help each other troubleshoot technical issues and share ideas. We'd love to have you join us!

## WP Engine Support

All WP Engine customers with paid plans have access to our award winning Support team 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by starting a live chat in the [User Portal](https://my.wpengine.com/). Be sure to have any error or response codes ready, as well as the names of your WP Engine environment and Headless app. If weâ€™re unable to assist you with a query, our Support specialists will do our best to guide you to resources with more information.

Customers using free Atlas Sandbox accounts do not have access to our Support team.

Please see our [Atlas Scope of Support](https://wpengine.com/support/atlas-scope-of-support/) page for more information.
