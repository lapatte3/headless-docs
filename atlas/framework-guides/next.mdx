title: Next.js on Atlas
description: Next.js is the most popular open source React-based framework.  It allows developers to use different rendering patterns at a page and component level for simple to complex sites and applications.  In this guide, you will learn how to deploy it on Atlas.

## Introduction

Next.js is the most popular open source React-based framework. It allows developers to use all the features you need for production in a front-end framework: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.
Check out their documentation for guides to all these key [features](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

## Deploy steps

To get started, you can run the following command to create a new Next.js project and the follow the steps in their [automatic setup guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#automatic-setup):

`npx create-next-app@latest`

Or, if you want to start with a template designed specifically for headless WordPress, you can clone one of these starter templates:

`git clone https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-wordpress-starter`

`git clone https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-wpgraphql-basic-starter`

`git clone https://github.com/JEverhart383/crash-course-headless-wp-next-wpgraphql`

To deploy your project to Atlas, it will need to be available on GitHub. The Next.js installation process lets us initialize a local repository for the project.

Create a new remote repository at [repo.new](https://github.com/new/), and then run the following commands to initialize and configure your local and remote repositories:

### Add remote repository

`$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>`

### Stage all changed files

`$ git add -A`

### Commit the files to the current branch

`$ git commit -m "initial commit"`

### Push changes to remote repository

`$ git push -u origin main`

## Build Details

Atlas detects that it is a Next.js app and runs the build scripts and configs necessary for the build details.

## Deploy Your Repository

Once your project is in GitHub, you can follow the [directions in our getting started guide](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/deploy-from-existing-repo) to deploy your project to Atlas.

## Best Practices

### Next Image:

The Next.js Image component, [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) , is an extension of the HTML <img> element, evolved for the modern web.
It includes a variety of built-in performance optimizations to help you achieve good Core Web Vitals.

One thing to keep in mind is when switching over your domains on Atlas, you must declare them in the `next.js.config` file, otherwise the images will not render. Here is a [stackoverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65124094/next-image-does-not-load-images-from-external-url-after-deployment) for reference.

Please visit the Next.js [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) for more in depth details on framework features.
