description: In this guide, you will learn how create and deploy an Astro application on the Atlas hosting platform.

## Introduction 
Astro is a sever-first framework for creating fast content-focused sites. You can run the framework either in SSR or SSG mode, and you can incorporate any of the popular frontend frameworks, like React, Vue, Svelte, etc. Astro is best used for content-focused sites, not web applications. Check out their docs for [some more details on when you should and should not use Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/) in your project.

## Deploy Steps

To get started, you can run the following command to create a new Remix project. When prompted, select `Remix App Server` in the console:
`npx create-remix@latest`

Or, if you want to start with a template designed specifically for headless WordPress, you can clone this starter template:

`git clone https://github.com/JEverhart383/remixing-wordpress`

After you have created your application, cd into your project directory:

`cd <your project directory>`

### Push Initial Commits to GitHub

To deploy your project to Atlas, it will need to be available on GitHub. 

Create a new remote repository at repo.new, and then run the following commands to initalize and configure your local and remote repositories:
  
```
# Add remote repository
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>

# Stage all changed files
$ git add -A

# Commit the files to the current branch
$ git commit -m "initial commit"

# Push changes to remote repository
$ git push -u origin main
```

### Build Details 
Using the `Remix App Server` selection, there are no additional changes needed to build or deploy a Remix app on Atlas.

### Deploy Your Repository
Once your project is in GitHub, you can follow the directions in our getting started guide to deploy your project to Atlas.
