## Introduction

Faust is a JavaScript framework designed to make the development of headless WordPress sites as easy as possible for WordPress and JavaScript developers.

The mission of Faust is to reduce the complexity of building headless WordPress frontends for the web, allowing the developer to build production sites with the ease of a monolithic WordPress site.

Check out their [documentation](https://faustjs.org/) for guides to all these key features.
