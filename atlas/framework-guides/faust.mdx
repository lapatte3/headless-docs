## Introduction

Faust is a JavaScript framework designed to make the development of headless WordPress sites as easy as possible for WordPress and JavaScript developers.
The mission of Faust is to reduce the complexity of building headless WordPress frontends for the web, allowing the developer to build production sites with the ease of a monolithic WordPress site.
Check out their [documentation](https://faustjs.org/) for guides to all these key features.

## Deploy steps

To get started, you can run the following command to create a new Faust.js project and the follow the steps in their getting started guide:
`npx create-next-app \ -e https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/main \ --example-path examples/next/faustwp-getting-started \ --use-npm`

After you have created your application, cd into your project directory:

`cd <your project directory>`

### Push Initial Commits to GitHub

To deploy your project to Atlas, it will need to be available on GitHub. The Faust.js installation process lets us initialize a local repository for the project.

Create a new remote repository at [repo.new](https://github.com/new/), and then run the following commands to initialize and configure your local and remote repositories:

### Add remote repository

`$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>`

### Stage all changed files

`$ git add -A`

### Commit the files to the current branch

`$ git commit -m "initial commit"`

### Push changes to remote repository

`$ git push -u origin main`

## Deploy Your Repository

Once your project is in GitHub, you can follow the [directions in our getting started guide](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/deploy-from-existing-repo) to deploy your project to Atlas.

## Build Details

Atlas detects that it is a Faust.js app and runs the build scripts and configs necessary for the build details.

One thing to note is the `next/cache` folder within your Faust.js project. Atlas caches common framework assests between builds to optimise build times. The build step will not override the [folder](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/atlas/customization/builds#framework-build-assets-cache).

## Best Practices

### Next Image in Faust.js:

The Next.js Image component, [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) , is an extension of the HTML <img> element, evolved for the modern web.
It includes a variety of built-in performance optimizations to help you achieve good Core Web Vitals.

One thing to keep in mind is when switching over your domains on Atlas, you must declare them in the `next.js.config` file, otherwise the images will not render. 

Please visit the Faust.js [documentation](https://faustjs.org/docs/getting-started) for more in depth details on framework features.
