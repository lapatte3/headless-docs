## Create an API Account in BigCommerce

In order to perform a sync you will first need to have an API Account created in BigCommerce which will provide you with the necessary credentials to use on the plugin admin configuration screen.

API Accounts can be used from existing BigCommerce Accounts or from trial accounts.
