title: Atlas Commerce Connector for BigCommerce - Hosted Checkout
description: Learn how to integrate your BigCommerce hosted checkout with the eCommerce Blueprint.
---

**Note**: These tutorials assume that you have already chosen and deployed the [Atlas Commerce Blueprint via our User Portal](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/blueprint-repository) and [configured the plugin with your BigCommerce API Account credentials](../tutorial/connecting-bigcommerce.mdx).

**Note**: The checkout page is the only part of the Blueprint that is not connected to BigCommerce out of the box. The cart inventory on this page will be reflective of the cart data on the Blueprint site on a refresh or new visit - but in terms of signing up for accounts, checking out with emails, linking back to the store and payments this is where we have left the integration incomplete. Further integration of the BigCommerce API and/or other payment systems is needed by developers at this point.

## Publishing the checkout page

By default your BigCommerce [stencil storefront](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/ZG9jOjIyMDY5Nw-about-stencil) will be inactive and in maintenance mode after setting up a trial store.
In order to allow customers to go to the checkout page hosted on this stencil theme from the headless WordPress site you will need to provide a **preview code** which can be aquired from the BigCommerce admin.

You can also publish your stencil theme in BigCommerce by going to `Channel Manager` and making your store active.

## Linking back to your headless cart from the BigCommerce checkout page

The default checkout functionality in the headless WordPress Blueprint is to take the user to the BigCommerce checkout hosted on the stencil theme with BigCommerce.
On this page there is a link back to `Edit Cart` which will go to the url of the stencil theme in BigCommerce and not the headless WordPress site the user came from.
Clicking the Store Name or Logo on the checkout page will also direct customers back to the stencil theme.

You will need to manually change this link back to your eCommerce Blueprint by [editing the stencil theme in BigCommerce directly](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Learning/Personalizing-your-New-Theme).
