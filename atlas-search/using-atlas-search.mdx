### Content Sync
Once you have installed & configured the Atlas Search plugin it will be necessary to run an initial content sync, which will index your WP site's data with Atlas Search.

After this initial sync, the Atlas Search plugin will continue to sync content in real-time whenever content additions or modifications occur on WP.

Note that, if the Atlas Search plugin is deactivated or uninstalled, real-time sync will not occur.

Content sync is performed via the Atlas Search plugin’s UI, as follows:
1. Click the ‘Atlas Search’ menu item in the WP Admin panel, then click the ‘Sync’ sub-menu item to bring up the below view.
2. Click the `Synchronize Now` button. Content Sync can take some time to complete, especially with large data sets. The content sync loading bar provides information on progress.
3. Await the ‘Sync Completed Successfully’ status message.
4. In the event that the sync process does not complete successfully, an error message of `Unexpected sync error occurred. Please try to Resume the sync or Delete what did sync, then start the sync process again` will be displayed -  at which point `Resume` & `Delete` buttons will be available for resuming from point of failure or purging & restarting the content sync respectively.

Once the Atlas Search’s Content Sync has completed you are free to query the content via the WPGraphQL and REST APIs.
The API search functions will look & feel just like they did before but will now be handled by Atlas Search.



### Using Atlas Search
Once the initial content sync has completed, & while the Atlas Search plugin remains “active”, Atlas Search will enhance your WP search experience.

The WP-GraphQL plugin is a good place to test this search experience. That plugin includes an instance of the ‘GraphiQL’ IDE, where one can interface in the browser with their WordPress data, via GraphQL queries. Atlas Search overrides the default search functionality for WPGraphQL queries on all Atlas Search supported WP data types.

Below is a screenshot of WP-GraphQL plugin & GraphiQL view, where Atlas Search has overrriden the default WP search behavior, followed by some sample queries:

#### Querying Standard WP Data Types:
For querying standard WordPress data types (Posts, Pages & Custom Post Types (CPT)) some examples are:

* Querying Posts/Pages:
```graphql
{
  {either ‘posts’ or ‘pages’}(where: {search: "CSS"}) {
    nodes {
      id
      status
      title
    }
  }
}
```
* Querying Custom Post Types:
```graphql
{
  branches(where: {search: "Austin"}) {
    nodes {
      address
    }
  }
}
```


#### Querying ACM or ACF Types:
Atlas Search also integrates with the [Atlas Content Modeler](https://developers.wpengine.com/blog/what-is-atlas-content-modeler) (ACM) & [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) (ACF).

* Querying ACM type of `project`, with fields of  `streetAddress`, `contactName` & `workOrderNumber`:
```graphql
{
  projects(where: {search: "Austin"}) {
    nodes {
      streetAddress
      contactName
      workOrderNumber
    }
  }
}
```


#### Getting More Specific with Queries:
Atlas Search treats spaces as `OR` by default, whereas the default WordPress search treats spaces as `AND`. With Atlas Search, however, you can explicitly specify the `AND`, `OR` & `NOT` keywords within your search query & you can combine them too - this provides enhanced specificity for your querying needs:

* Using `NOT` search operator:
```graphql
{
  projects(where: {search: "Austin NOT Minnesota"}) {
    nodes {
      streetAddress
      contactName
      workOrderNumber
    }
  }
}
```

* Using `AND` search operator:
```graphql
{
  projects(where: {search: "New York AND Texas"}) {
    nodes {
      streetAddress
      contactName
      workOrderNumber
    }
  }
}
```

* Using `OR` search operator:
```graphql
{
  projects(where: {search: "New York OR Texas"}) {
    nodes {
      streetAddress
      contactName
      workOrderNumber
    }
  }
}
```


## Advanced Configuration
For those users who have more specific functionality needs Atlas Search provides a series of advanced configurations to give you the most control on your data search.

### Search Method
Atlas Search provides two methods for searching, `stemming` and `fuzzy`, which can be used to tune the search results for your needs.

### High Relevancy with Stemming Search
Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its root form. This is the default search method of Atlas Search. Using stemming can provide increased search relevancy as it will search for both exact matches and matches on stemmed words.
For example, a search for the word `running` will return results where running is in the queried field first but it will also return results that include the word `run`.

### Handling Typos with Fuzzy Search
The fuzzy search method can be toggled in the Atlas Search settings menu. Fuzzy search can be used to handle typos in a search query.
With fuzziness setup a search query for "Hallo Warld" will return results for both "Hello" and "World".

This fuzziness can be toggled, along with modifying this per-word distance (to, let's assume, the maximum distance of 2) in the plugin menu’s ‘Search Config’ view - in this case a search query of "Haalo Waald" would work as per the previous example, yielding also the results for both "Hello" and "World".

Please note that the higher the fuzziness distance allowed the greater the performance & relevancy hit will be to your search experience.

#### Filtering And Boosting Searchable Content
Atlas Search, by default, will search all supported WP Data Type objects (Posts, Pages, CPTs, ACFs, ACMs, etc.) by all of their supported fields (string, number, boolean, other WP Data Type objects).

Atlas Search will then return results where each field-match to the search query term(s) are given an equal weighting (1), thus the objects with most search-match occurrences will rise to the top. In some cases this may not be the desired behavior, for example:
* It may not be correct to consider some specific fields as searchable
* Searches matching some fields should be considered more relevant than others

To cater for these type of use cases, Atlas Search provides both a field-level searchable toggle, and a field-level weighting slider, which can be found in the plugin menu’s ‘Search Config’ view.

The searchable toggle allows for the inclusion/exclusion of a field from the search.

The field-level weighting slider permits the configuration of some fields to be considered more relevant than others when decising on ordering of search results. The higher the weighting, the more relevant it is deemed to be.

Remember to press the ‘Save’ button to persist any configuration modifications!
