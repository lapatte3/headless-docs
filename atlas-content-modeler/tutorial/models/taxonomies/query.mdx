### Steps to Query a Taxonomy using WPGraphQL

You can find detailed steps in the basic usage of WPGraphQL here: [WPGraphQL Quick Start](https://www.wpgraphql.com/docs/quick-start/)

The steps below are more specific on how to query content models by taxonomy. This assumes you have already [Created a Model](../create.mdx), and [Created a Taxonomy](create.mdx) for that model. The query below is in GraphiQL in the WordPress plugin WPGraphQL.

#### Example Query 1

This example queries a Model called Employees. Employees uses the **LOCATION** Taxonomy. In this case, we are querying the term **dallas** and the taxonomy **LOCATION** inside of the **taxQuery: {}** object.

```
{
  employees(first: 10,
    where: {
      taxQuery: {        
        taxArray: [
          {
            terms: ["dallas"],
            taxonomy: LOCATION,
            operator: IN,
            field: SLUG
          }
        ]
      }
  	}
  ){
    nodes {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example Query 2

This example queries a Model called Companies. Companies uses the **REGION** Taxonomy. In this case, we are querying the term **east coast** and the taxonomy **REGION** inside of the **taxQuery: {}** object.

```
{
  companies(first: 2,
    where: {
      taxQuery: {        
        taxArray: [
          {
            terms: ["east coast"],
            taxonomy: REGION,
            operator: IN,
            field: SLUG
          }
        ]
      }
  	}
  ){
    nodes {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
